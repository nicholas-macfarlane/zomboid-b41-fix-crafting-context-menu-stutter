name=Crafting Context Menu Stutter Fix
id=FixCraftingContextMenuStutter
description=This mod changes the crafting hover tooltip algorithm to only show materials that the player has available.
This removes the hover stutter seen when a large amount of materials are registered for crafting recipes - AuthenticZ + the rip sheets/ craft sheet rope context menu options is a perfect example of what this fixes.
